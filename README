*Requires following rootScope variables to work:*

$rootScope.homeStateName : the name of the state (depends on stateProvider service) to redirect after logout

$rootScope.loginBaseUrl : absolute base url of login API. E.g if "http://fuzzy.com/api/v0/ is given, 
service will attempt to login to "fuzzy.com/api/v0/account/user/login" 
and will provide credentials in the form of an object as { username:"myusername", password:"mypassword" }
